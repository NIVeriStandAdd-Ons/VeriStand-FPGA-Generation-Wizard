VeriStand-FPGA-Wizard
===================

The VeriStand FPGA Wizard removes the need to program with LabVIEW FPGA when using FPGAs with VeriStand. The wizard generates the LabVIEW FPGA VI for the user. The user simply compiles it and configures VeriStand. Currently, it supports generating FPGAs utiltize FPGA IP from the FPGA Addon and the Engine Simulation Toolkit.
